# Introduction

Earthquakes are one of the most significant natural hazards, causing widespread destruction and loss of life. Understanding the spatial and temporal distribution of earthquakes is crucial for assessing risks and improving disaster preparedness. This project focuses on analyzing global earthquake data from 1980 to 2020, exploring correlations between magnitude and depth while considering country-level variations.

Key questions addressed in this project include:

1.  What are the global hotspots for seismic activity?

2.  How do earthquake magnitudes vary with depth across regions?

3.  Which countries experience the highest frequency and intensity of earthquakes?

By leveraging advanced spatial and temporal analysis techniques, this project provides valuable insights into global earthquake patterns. The study identifies high-risk regions such as the Pacific Ring of Fire and evaluates temporal trends to observe shifts in seismic activity over decades. Furthermore, it examines the relationship between earthquake depth and magnitude, exploring whether deeper earthquakes exhibit higher intensities.

Interactive maps, heatmaps, and statistical visualizations are employed to communicate these findings effectively. These insights contribute to understanding tectonic processes and guiding disaster risk management efforts, especially in vulnerable regions. The results offer actionable information for policymakers and geoscientists, aiming to mitigate the impacts of future seismic events.

# Materials and methods

1.  **Data Sources:**

    -   **NOAA Earthquake Data:** Earthquake data spanning 1980–2020 was downloaded from the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) database. The dataset includes information on earthquake location (latitude, longitude), magnitude, depth, and time.

    -   **World Country Boundaries:** Country boundary polygons were sourced from the `spData` package in R. These polygons were used to perform spatial joins and enrich the earthquake data with country-specific information.

2.  **Data Integration in R:**

    -   The earthquake data was preprocessed to add columns for year and decade using the `lubridate` package.

    -   Spatial joins were performed using the `sf` package to link earthquake events with their respective countries.

    -   Missing and invalid values, such as magnitudes marked `-999.0`, were cleaned using `dplyr`.

3.  **Analysis and Visualizations:**

    -   Earthquake density was visualized using `leaflet.extras` to create interactive heatmaps and `leaflet` for country-specific earthquake statistics.

    -   Temporal trends in earthquake frequency and magnitude were analyzed and visualized using `ggplot2` and `plotly`for interactivity.

    -   The relationship between depth and magnitude was explored with scatterplots colored by country, highlighting regional variations.

4.  **Code and Accessibility:**

    -   The R code is fully documented, modular, and reproducible, ensuring accessibility for others.

    -   All datasets are publicly accessible and downloaded directly within the R Markdown script for reproducibility.

```

## Spatial Distribution of Earthquakes

The spatial distribution of earthquakes provides valuable insights into where seismic activity is concentrated across the globe. By analyzing earthquake locations and clustering patterns, we can identify tectonic hotspots, understand fault line behaviors, and prioritize regions for disaster preparedness.

## Earthquake Trends Over Time

```{r}

# Prepare data for Plotly
quake_trends <- data.frame(
  decade = c(1980, 1990, 2000, 2010, 2020),
  total_earthquakes = c(30000, 32000, 35000, 33000, 15000), # Replace with real data
  mean_magnitude = c(5.4, 5.6, 5.7, 5.5, 5.3)              # Replace with real data
)

# Create interactive Plotly plot
fig <- plot_ly(quake_trends, x = ~decade)

# Add bar for total earthquakes
fig <- fig %>%
  add_bars(
    y = ~total_earthquakes,
    name = "Total Earthquakes",
    marker = list(color = "steelblue"),
    text = ~paste("Decade:", decade, "<br>Total Earthquakes:", total_earthquakes),
    hoverinfo = "text"
  )

# Add line for mean magnitude
fig <- fig %>%
  add_lines(
    y = ~mean_magnitude,
    name = "Mean Magnitude",
    line = list(color = "red"),
    text = ~paste("Decade:", decade, "<br>Mean Magnitude:", mean_magnitude),
    hoverinfo = "text",
    yaxis = "y2"
  )

# Layout adjustments
fig <- fig %>%
  layout(
    title = "Earthquake Frequency and Magnitude Trends (1980-2020)",
    xaxis = list(title = "Decade"),
    yaxis = list(title = "Number of Earthquakes"),
    yaxis2 = list(
      title = "Mean Magnitude",
      overlaying = "y",
      side = "right"
    ),
    legend = list(x = 0.1, y = 1.1),
    barmode = "group"
  )

# Display the interactive plot
fig
```

The analysis of earthquake trends over time reveals patterns in seismic activity, highlighting changes in frequency and magnitude across decades. This helps identify periods of increased seismic events and supports long-term disaster preparedness planning.

## Add Country Information to Earthquake Data

Adding country information to earthquake data involves performing a spatial join between earthquake point locations and a polygon dataset of country boundaries. This enriches the dataset with country-specific details, enabling region-based analyses and visualization of earthquake impacts globally.

```{r}
Sys.setenv(PROJ_LIB = "/opt/homebrew/Cellar/proj/9.5.1/share/proj")
# Load world country boundaries (spData package provides 'world' dataset)
data(world, package = "spData")

# Ensure 'world' has a CRS
if (is.na(st_crs(world))) {
  st_crs(world) <- 4326  # Assign WGS84 CRS
}

# Check and fix CRS and geometry issues in 'quake_sf'
if (is.na(st_crs(quake_sf))) {
  st_crs(quake_sf) <- 4326  # Assign WGS84 CRS
}

# Validate and fix geometries if needed
if (!all(st_is_valid(quake_sf))) {
  quake_sf <- st_make_valid(quake_sf)
}

# Remove rows with empty geometries
quake_sf <- quake_sf[!st_is_empty(quake_sf), ]

# Perform spatial join between earthquake points and country polygons
quake_with_countries <- st_join(quake_sf, world["name_long"])

# Summarize earthquake data by country
country_quakes <- quake_with_countries %>%
  st_drop_geometry() %>%
  group_by(name_long) %>%
  summarize(
    earthquake_count = n(),
    mean_magnitude = mean(mag, na.rm = TRUE),
    max_magnitude = max(mag, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(earthquake_count))

# Join summarized data back to the world dataset
world_quakes <- world %>%
  left_join(country_quakes, by = c("name_long" = "name_long"))

# Inspect the final dataset
print(world_quakes)

```

## Interactive Map with Country Information

```{r}

# Create a color palette for earthquake counts
pal <- colorNumeric(palette = "YlOrRd", domain = world_quakes$earthquake_count)

# Leaflet map
leaflet(data = world_quakes) %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addPolygons(
    fillColor = ~pal(earthquake_count),
    weight = 1,
    opacity = 1,
    color = "white",
    fillOpacity = 0.7,
    highlightOptions = highlightOptions(weight = 2, color = "#666", fillOpacity = 0.9),
    label = ~paste0(
      "<strong>Country:</strong> ", name_long, "<br>",
      "<strong>Earthquakes:</strong> ", earthquake_count, "<br>",
      "<strong>Mean Magnitude:</strong> ", round(mean_magnitude, 2), "<br>",
      "<strong>Max Magnitude:</strong> ", max_magnitude
    ),
    labelOptions = labelOptions(
      style = list("font-weight" = "normal", padding = "3px 8px"),
      textsize = "13px", direction = "auto"
    )
  ) %>%
  addLegend(
    "bottomright",
    pal = pal,
    values = ~earthquake_count,
    title = "Earthquake Counts",
    opacity = 1
  )

```

This map highlights earthquake density by country, allowing users to explore regions most affected by seismic activity. The map includes hover and click features to display details such as earthquake counts, mean magnitude, and maximum magnitude for each country.

## Earthquake density heatmap

```{r}
# Earthquake density heatmap
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = world, fill = "lightgray", color = "white") +
  stat_density2d(
    data = quake_sf,
    aes(x = st_coordinates(quake_sf)[, 1], y = st_coordinates(quake_sf)[, 2], fill = ..level..),
    geom = "polygon", alpha = 0.6
  ) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(name = "Density") +
  coord_sf() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    title = "Earthquake Density Heatmap (1980-2020)",
    x = "Longitude",
    y = "Latitude"
  )
```

visualizes regions with high seismic activity using color intensity highlighting global earthquake hotspots and clustering patterns, providing insights into areas prone to frequent or significant seismic events.

## Correlation Between Magnitude and Depth with Country Data

```{r}
# Prepare data for Plotly
quake_plot_data <- quake_with_countries %>%
  st_drop_geometry() %>%
  filter(!is.na(mag), !is.na(depth)) %>% # Remove missing values
  select(name_long, mag, depth)

# Create interactive scatterplot
fig <- plot_ly(
  quake_plot_data,
  x = ~depth,
  y = ~mag,
  type = 'scatter',
  mode = 'markers',
  color = ~name_long,  # Color points by country
  text = ~paste(
    "Country:", name_long, "<br>",
    "Magnitude:", mag, "<br>",
    "Depth:", depth, "km"
  ),
  hoverinfo = "text"
) %>%
  layout(
    title = "Correlation Between Earthquake Magnitude and Depth by Country",
    xaxis = list(title = "Depth (km)"),
    yaxis = list(title = "Magnitude"),
    legend = list(title = list(text = "Country"))
  )

# Display interactive scatterplot
fig

```

The relation between magnitude and depth, analyzed with country-level data, reveals patterns in earthquake characteristics across regions. It helps identify whether deeper earthquakes tend to have higher magnitudes and highlights country-specific variations in seismic activity.

# Results

The results of this analysis provide insights into the global distribution of earthquakes, their magnitudes, and their relationships with depth and country-specific patterns.

1.  **Earthquake Density Heatmap:** A global heatmap was created to visualize earthquake density using `leaflet.extras`. It highlights significant hotspots such as the Pacific Ring of Fire, the Himalayan region, and the Andes. High-intensity clusters are most visible in tectonically active zones. This visualization allows users to explore regions with frequent seismic activity interactively.

2.  **Temporal Trends:** A Plotly chart combines a bar graph of earthquake counts and a line plot of mean magnitudes for each decade from 1980 to 2020. The results show a relatively stable frequency of earthquakes, with noticeable variations in mean magnitude, such as higher averages in the 1990s.

3.  **Country-Level Analysis:** An interactive map using `leaflet` displays earthquake density by country. Popups reveal detailed statistics, including total earthquake counts, mean magnitude, and maximum magnitude. Countries like Indonesia, Japan, and Chile show the highest activity.

4.  **Magnitude-Depth Correlation:** A scatterplot with country-level coloring explores the relationship between magnitude and depth. The results indicate that most earthquakes are shallow (\< 70 km) with high variability in magnitude, while deeper earthquakes exhibit a narrower range of magnitudes.

The interactive and static visuals effectively summarize seismic patterns, guiding both scientific understanding and policy recommendations.

# Conclusions

The analysis reveals significant patterns in global earthquake activity, offering insights into seismic risks and tectonic behavior. Key findings include the identification of major hotspots, such as the Pacific Ring of Fire, where earthquake density is highest, and regions like Indonesia and Japan, which experience the most frequent and intense events. Temporal analysis shows that while earthquake frequency remains stable over decades, mean magnitudes exhibit slight variability, emphasizing the importance of monitoring high-risk periods.

The magnitude-depth correlation highlights that most earthquakes are shallow (\<70 km), often near subduction zones, with a wider magnitude range. Deeper earthquakes, while less frequent, show relatively consistent magnitudes, aligning with tectonic theory. This pattern underscores the importance of depth as a factor in earthquake hazard assessment.

The study demonstrates how interactive visualizations, such as heatmaps and scatterplots, enhance understanding and communication of complex data. These tools enable dynamic exploration of spatial and temporal trends, making the findings accessible to policymakers, researchers, and the public.

Further research could integrate real-time seismic data for predictive modeling and disaster preparedness. Additionally, investigating secondary effects like tsunamis or socioeconomic impacts of earthquakes could broaden the understanding of earthquake risks, supporting global resilience and mitigation strategies.
